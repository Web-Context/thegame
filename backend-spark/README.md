# TheGame 

## the web mongo edition

This small Web Java application is the similar AngularJS implementation than TheGame (in the [same bitbucket account](https://bitbucket.org/webcontext/thegame)), but implementing the [SparkJava](http://sparkjava.com) web framework.

Using some last of the maven technology to build frontend javascript application (see [the frontend-maven-plugin](https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin)).

Have Fun !
